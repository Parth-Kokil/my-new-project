 GreenThumb AI
GreenThumb AI is an intelligent plant care assistant that uses AI to monitor and analyze plant health through images and environmental data. It helps users optimize watering, lighting, and nutrient needs for their plants.

### Background

Many indoor plant owners struggle to keep their plants healthy because they lack knowledge about precise watering schedules, light exposure, or pest control. This problem is very common among urban dwellers who want to enjoy greenery but have busy lifestyles or limited gardening experience.

I am personally motivated by my love for plants and frustration with seeing them wilt despite my efforts. Helping people keep plants alive supports better mental health and air quality indoors, making this topic both interesting and valuable.

### Data and AI techniques

GreenThumb AI depends on data collected from user-uploaded plant images, moisture sensors, and environmental data such as light and temperature.

The availability of diverse, labeled images of various plant species and conditions is essential to train robust AI models.

The project employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification to detect plant health issues like wilting or pests, and time-series analysis to predict watering needs based on sensor data.

### How is it used

Users interact with GreenThumb AI via a mobile app. They upload photos of their plants and connect compatible sensors. The AI analyzes the images and sensor readings to provide personalized care advice and alerts.

This solution is mainly targeted at indoor plant enthusiasts and urban gardeners who want to improve their plant care without needing expert knowledge. It also benefits plant shops by providing digital health assessments.

### Challenges

GreenThumb AI does not replace expert botanists or address all plant diseases, especially rare or emerging issues.

Challenges include varying image quality from users, limited labeled datasets for some rare plants, and ensuring data privacy for users. The AI may produce false positives or miss subtle signs without extensive training.

### What next

Future work could integrate real-time video analysis, expand plant species coverage, and incorporate community-driven data sharing to improve AI accuracy.

Collaboration with botanists and access to large-scale plant health datasets would enhance the modelâ€™s effectiveness. Adding voice interaction and plant marketplace integration are also possible next steps.
